Dev Bootcamp Student Blogs
--------------------------
These are some blogs that DBC students have written. They will give you good insight into what the program we are running is like for other Boots and the technical posts might also help you later on. For example I had an experience while in San Francisco where I a student came up to me to ask a question about AJAX (you will learn about that in Phase 2) and I refered him to one of the blogs below! It was another great example of students teaching students and how writing about programming at any stage can be helpful to others.
